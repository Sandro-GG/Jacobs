a)
    By commenting out using namespace std we are left with many standard
    functions without the namespace, including cout, cin, endl, string.
    Hence, to avoid errors we need to type std::cout, std::cin, etc.

b)
    By commenting out Critter:: the compiler is left confused, because
    it doesn't understand where the function is coming from. In this case,
    the function is inside the critter class, so we need to specify that.
